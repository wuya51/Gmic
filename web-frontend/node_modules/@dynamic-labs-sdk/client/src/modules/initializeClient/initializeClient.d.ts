 * Initializes the Dynamic client and all its modules and services.

 * This function orchestrates the initialization of authentication, project settings,
 * session keys, and storage sync. It manages the initialization status and handles
 * any errors that occur during the process.
 *
 * You only need to call this function if you are not using `autoInitialize: true` in createDynamicClient.
 *
 * @param [client] - The Dynamic client instance. Only required when using multiple Dynamic clients.
 * @returns A promise that resolves when initialization is complete.
 * @throws ClientAlreadyInitializedError If the client is already initialized.
